                <summary>Question - So what is Bio waste reprocessing? Is this a fancy name for sewage processing?</summary>
                <br>
                <p>Answer - You have made an astute observation that this work type does involve dealing with human waste products. Although this is not glamorous it is one of the most critical parts of the colony as the reuse of all biological matter is critical.</p>

                <summary>Question - If I don't like it, can I come home?</summary>
                <br>
                <p>Answer - You haven't even singed up and your thinking about coming home! Well it is a fair question and you get credit for thinking ahead. At this time very limited space will be made available for passengers on returning miner ships. As per the contract, once approved, a return fee will be calculated based on 2X body weight, based on the "time of ship" price of the commodity the ship carrying.</p>

                <summary>Question - How will I communicate with folks back home?</summary>
                <br>
                <p>Answer -  How loud can you shout? Fear not, if your voice won't carry over the nearly half a billion kilometres of void between mars and earth then you can purchase data bundles. It is recommended to use your data for unformatted text email, as of Nov 2044 the cost of sending 1 second of low quality audio is roughly 1000 Euro / 1.8M Dollars</p>
