            <details>
                <summary>So what is Bio waste reprocessing? Is this a fancy name for sewage?</summary>
                <p>You have made an astute observation, this work type does involve dealing with human waste products. Although this is not glamorous, it is one of the most critical parts of the colony, the reuse of all biological matter is critical.</p> 
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>If I don't like it, can I come home?</summary>
                <p>You haven't even singed up and your thinking about coming home! Well it is a fair question and you get credit for thinking ahead. At this time very limited space will be made available for passengers on returning miner ships. As per the contract, once approved, a return fee will be calculated based a complex and highly extortionate algorithm</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How will I communicate with folks back home?</summary>
                <p>How loud can you shout? Fear not, if your voice won't carry over the nearly half a billion kilometres of void between mars and earth then you can purchase data bundles. It is recommended to use your data for unformatted text email, as of Nov 2044 the cost of sending 1 second of low quality audio is roughly 1000 Euro / 1.8M Dollars</p> 
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Sounds like water is not going to be overly abundant there at the start, will I still get my daily bath?</summary>
                <p>The conservation of water is one of the critical standing orders on Mars Colony One. Baths are strictly prohibited. We recommend bringing a photo of your rubber ducky as an inspiration to join the ice mining crews at the poles.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I get paid?</summary>
                <p>Is being part of the next stage in human advancement not enough reward in itself? Any contributory task you complete on the colony will earn you UMC (Universal Mars Credits), once you have paid back the initial flight and setup costs, your account will be in credit and UMC can be used to purchase items at approved vendors</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>There are initial costs?</summary>
                <p>You didn't honestly think this would be free? The cost of transportation will be based on a complex algorithm that takes into account your total weight (including all personal items) which is offset by your calculated contribution possibility index. As with all earth endeavours, crippling personal debt is a badge of honour and will enable you to make optimal choices in you daily living activities so they benefit the colony's growth and profitability</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I bring my pet cat?</summary>
                <p>It depends. If it has been liquidated into a high protein paste that you wish to declare as food on the transport ships itinerary, then yes. If you want to bring it, in a normal alive cat state, then unfortunately this will not be possible as, the costs involved in air filtration alone, would lead to our financial controllers having heart palpitations. This applies to all pets, and any hairy garments.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will the colony be using robots?</summary>
                <p>A limited number of LI (low-level intelligence) robots will be present from the foundation of the colony ,but large scale introduction will not be till a later stage, once the environment has been deemed stable. If there is a catastrophic collapse in the number of colonists during the early phases then mission will be scrapped. StarSeed fiscal policy will limit the hardware we send due to astronomical reclamation costs.</p>
