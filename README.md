## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**

* Users interested in space travel 
* Users interested in new work oppertunities
* Users interested in a new challange
​
### **User Stories:**
​
User stories are more what the user wants from the site in terms of features and presentation
​
* As a user, I want to quickly understand the subject and how it relates to me
* As a user, I want to navigate through content easily
* As a user, I want to learn more about the product/service
* As a user, I want to easily view the site with whatever device and browser I am using 
​
### **Site Aims:**
​
* To trigger an interest in Mars with the user
* To make the user understand the mission to colonise mars
* To provide key details about the mission and what to expect
* To get contact information from the user for future recruitment
​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
Wireframes were built in Balsamiq as a foundation but there has been an organic evolution of the desing during construction of the site and testing across the different devices
Orgininal wireframs in PDF here
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
I took inspiration for the colour palate from Mars itself and built out from that core color

Mars Orange
Space Black
Blue Atmosphere
​
## **Typography**
​
I was aiming for a sci-fi looks and feel without going overboard and alianting users
The logo and heading use Exo 2 font
Arial is used in other areas
​
## **Site-Wide Features**
​
#### *logo*

The page logo embraces a simple sci-fi astectic
Using Exo 2 font to look modern/futurist while still highly readable.
#### *Navigation Bar:*
This is an example of the features section, your going to talk about each section of the page and what it offers for the navbar for example
​
* The user is given links to each section of the page
* Each option is presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
* on smaller screens a hamburger menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
​
#### *features
​
* This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
* user account creation
* user application tracking

​
* At the time of making this page i didn't have the understanding to actual send e-mails from the contact form so intergration with email.js to send e-mails would improve the users experience
​
* Due to the subject matter, we have discussed the idea of including a small JS game to engage the user
​
## **Testing Phase**


​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
We always have bugs in development, a few bullet points here to talk about bugs you found and how you fixed them, in later projects this will be more detailed
​
* Issue - When on mobile the user had horizontal scroll with items overflowing
* Cause - The images had absolute positioning and caused them to go off screen
* Resolution - Changed the width of the image to stay within the confines of the screen.
​

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](pageurl), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.

​
Here mention what technologies you've used for example
​
- HTML5
- CSS3

- Powerpoint & Paint.net for starseed logo
​
## **Credits**
### **Honorable mentions**
​
It's always nice to mention those that helped you get there, if people gave you support on slack or the local cat scared you into completing give them a mention!
​
### **Content:**
​
I used code from https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/ example 1
This was used as a starting point for the advanced animations but I made extensive changes to make the menu fit my sites style
  
### **Media:**
​
Links to the locations of images if you've used them from an online source!
