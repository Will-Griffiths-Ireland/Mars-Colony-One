                <h2>Words From Our Founder</h2>
                <br>
                <p>“I started StarSeed Industries with a vision, a vision of growth, not of my company but of humanity across space</p>
                <br>
                <p>I could see families raising their children and looking back towards earth with pride at how much they had acomplished.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>Today, through multiple technological breakthroughs, we are tantalisingly close to making life on another planet, a reality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I hold out my hand to you, join us, and be part of something wonderful.</p>
                <p>I won’t tell you it’s going to be easy, because it’s not, there are many challenges to overcome, but with perseverance, we will succeed, and all will share in the rewards”</p>
